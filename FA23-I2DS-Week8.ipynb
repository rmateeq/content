    "4. **`recipes = eval(file.read())`**\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   - The code prompts the user to enter the ID of the recipe they want to delete.\n",
    "   - The input is converted to an integer using `int()` since the recipe IDs are expected to be integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Checking Recipe Existence:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if recipe_id_to_delete in recipes:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This condition checks if the entered `recipe_id_to_delete` exists in the `recipes` dictionary.\n",
    "   - If the recipe ID exists, the code proceeds with deleting the recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deleting Recipe:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   deleted_recipe_name = recipes[recipe_id_to_delete]['name']\n",
    "   del recipes[recipe_id_to_delete]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the entered recipe ID exists in the dictionary, the code retrieves the name of the recipe associated with that ID.\n",
    "   - The `del` statement is used to remove the entry with the specified recipe ID from the `recipes` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print Outcome:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(f\"Recipe '{deleted_recipe_name}' deleted successfully!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If a recipe was successfully deleted, the code prints a success message indicating the name of the deleted recipe.\n",
    "   - This message is formatted using an f-string to include the dynamic value of `deleted_recipe_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Handling Non-Existent Recipe ID:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Invalid recipe ID. No recipe deleted.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - If the entered recipe ID does not exist in the `recipes` dictionary, the code prints an error message indicating that no recipe was deleted.\n",
    "   - This provides feedback to the user if they entered an invalid recipe ID."

    "**Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `os` library is imported, which provides a way to interact with the operating system, such as checking if a file exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constants:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   DATA_FILE = \"recipes.txt\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - A constant named `DATA_FILE` is defined with the value \"recipes.txt\". This constant represents the file where recipe data will be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Function:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def main():\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `main` function is defined, serving as the entry point for running the recipe manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loading Existing Recipes:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   recipes = load_recipes()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `load_recipes()` function is called to load existing recipes from the data file (if it exists). The loaded recipes are stored in the `recipes` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Main Loop:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while True:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Initiates an infinite loop that continues until explicitly broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Displaying User Menu:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   display_menu()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Calls the `display_menu()` function to print the user menu options to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **User Input:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   choice = input(\"Enter your choice: \")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Prompts the user to enter their choice by typing a number corresponding to a menu option.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Menu Option Handling:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if choice == '1':\n",
    "       add_recipe(recipes)\n",
    "   elif choice == '2':\n",
    "       view_recipes(recipes)\n",
    "   elif choice == '3':\n",
    "       search_recipe(recipes)\n",
    "   elif choice == '4':\n",
    "       delete_recipe(recipes)\n",
    "   elif choice == '5':\n",
    "       save_recipes(recipes)\n",
    "       print(\"Exiting Recipe Manager. Goodbye!\")\n",
    "       break\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Invalid choice. Please try again.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Based on the user's input, the program executes different actions:\n",
    "     - If the user chooses '1', it calls the `add_recipe()` function to add a new recipe.\n",
    "     - If the user chooses '2', it calls the `view_recipes()` function to display existing recipes.\n",
    "     - If the user chooses '3', it calls the `search_recipe()` function to search for recipes.\n",
    "     - If the user chooses '4', it calls the `delete_recipe()` function to delete a recipe.\n",
    "     - If the user chooses '5', it calls the `save_recipes()` function to save modifications and exits the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Exiting the Program:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       main()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Checks if the script is being run as the main program (not imported as a module) and then calls the `main()` function to start the recipe manager."

    "**Description:**\n",
    "1. A new function, `add_recipe_with_quantities`, is introduced to facilitate the addition of recipes with ingredient quantities.\n",

    "3. The entered ingredients and quantities are stored in a dictionary (`ingredients_with_quantities`).\n",
    "4. The recipe is then added to the `recipes` dictionary with the additional information about ingredient quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
    "- Modify the menu in the `display_menu` function to include an option for adding a recipe with quantities.\n",
    "- Update the `main` loop to handle the new menu option appropriately.\n",
