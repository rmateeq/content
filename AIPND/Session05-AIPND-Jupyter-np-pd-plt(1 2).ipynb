You can load datasets, clean and preprocess data, perform computations, and visualize results, all within a single document.\n","\n","2. **Reproducibility and Documentation**: Notebooks provide a reproducible workflow as code, visualizations, and text are combined in one place. You can document your analysis steps, include explanatory text, and share your findings, making it easier for others to understand and reproduce your work.\n","\n","3. **Visualization and Storytelling**: Notebooks support the integration of rich media, including interactive plots, images, videos, and mathematical equations. This enables you to create compelling visualizations and tell a story with your data, making your analysis more engaging and informative.\n","\n","4. **Collaboration and Sharing**: Jupyter Notebooks can be easily shared with others, promoting collaboration and fostering a community of knowledge sharing. You can share your notebooks as files, through platforms like GitHub or GitLab, or publish them on Jupyter Notebook hosting services like Jupyter Notebook Viewer or Google Colab.\n","\n","By leveraging the capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks, you can conduct data analysis, experiment with code, document your workflow, and communicate your findings effectively in a single, versatile environment.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kDWnm-0bD84F"},"source":["# Concepts Behind Jupyter Notebooks\n","\n","Jupyter Notebooks are built on a few key concepts that contribute to their functionality and flexibility:\n","\n","1. **Cells**: Notebooks are composed of cells, which can be of different types, such as Markdown cells for text, code cells for executing code, and raw cells for unprocessed text.\n","\n","2. **Kernel**: Each notebook runs on a specific kernel, which is responsible for executing the code within the notebook. The kernel can be associated with a particular programming language like Python, R, or Julia.\n","\n","3. **Code Execution**: Code cells can be executed individually or in a specific order. The output of code execution, such as printed results or visualizations, is displayed directly below the executed cell.\n","\n","4. **State Persistence**: The state of variables and code execution is preserved throughout the notebook. This means that variables defined in one cell can be accessed and used in subsequent cells, allowing for interactive and incremental development.\n","\n","5. **Interactivity**: Jupyter Notebooks support an interactive workflow, enabling you to edit and re-execute code cells, modify visualizations, and observe the immediate results.\n","\n","6. **Markdown and LaTeX**: Notebooks support Markdown formatting, which allows you to write text, add headings, create lists, and incorporate hyperlinks. Additionally, LaTeX notation is supported for mathematical equations and symbols.\n","\n","Understanding these underlying concepts will help you effectively utilize the features and capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks, enabling you to perform data analysis, experimentation, and documentation seamlessly.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"InC3yF65FSGa"},"source":["# How Notebooks Work?\n","- Jupyter notebooks originated from the IPython project and were initially designed to send messages between a web app and an IPython kernel.\n","- The current architecture involves a notebook server that renders the notebook as a web app in the browser.\n","Code written in the web app is sent through the server to the kernel for execution.\n","- The kernel processes the code and sends the output back to the server, which renders it in the browser.\n","Notebooks are saved as JSON files with the .ipynb extension on the server.\n","- The kernel can be used for languages other than Python, making notebooks language agnostic.\n","The name \"Jupyter\" comes from a combination of Julia, Python, and R, representing the ability to use different kernels for different languages.\n","- Jupyter notebooks offer the flexibility of running the server locally or on a remote machine or cloud instance.\n","- Accessing the notebooks via a browser allows for worldwide accessibility to the notebook files stored on the server."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GDgS73oFF22u"},"source":["# Code Cell"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":458,"status":"ok","timestamp":1700590497976,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Ateeq","userId":"03734412434342361168"},"user_tz":-300},"id":"J4QoX4NXEGeV","outputId":"3ea669d3-4c32-415e-bbe3-27aa8feba864"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The square of 6 is: 36\n"]}],"source":["# Simple Python code example\n","\n","# Define a function to calculate the square of a number\n","def square(x):\n","    return x ** 2\n","\n","# Calculate the square of a given number\n","number = 6\n","result = square(number)\n","print(f\"The square of {number} is: {result}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kKzam8J1GUUs"},"source":["# Installing, Launching, and Using\n","\n","- Install Python: Better go with Anaconda and you will get Jupyter Notebooks with it.\n","\n","- Install Jupyter: If installing separately, once Python is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and use the following command to install Jupyter using pip, the Python package manager:\n","```\n","pip install jupyter\n","```\n","- Launch Jupyter Notebook: After successful installation, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n","```\n","jupyter notebook\n","```\n","- Jupyter Server Start: Jupyter Notebook will start a local server and open a web browser window displaying the Jupyter dashboard.\n","- Create a New Notebook: To create a new notebook, click on the \"New\" button in the Jupyter dashboard and select the desired programming language kernel (e.g., Python 3) to associate with the notebook."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zcClxvJnHoRv"},"source":["## Magic keyword\n","also known as magic commands or magic functions, are special commands in Jupyter Notebooks that provide additional functionality beyond what is available in regular Python code.

serve different purposes and work well together in data analysis. Here are a few key reasons why Pandas is needed in addition to NumPy:\n","- Data structures: Pandas provides high-level data structures like DataFrames and Series to facilitate data manipulation. NumPy only offers ndarrays.\n","- Indexing: Pandas has powerful indexing functionality like .loc, .iloc, .at that make it easier to subset and transform data. NumPy indexing is more limited.\n","- Missing data: Pandas handles missing data gracefully with NaN values. NumPy ndarrays require other packages like Numpy-MA for missing data.\n","- Data alignment: Pandas aligns data based on labels during operations. NumPy performs crude alignment based on array order.\n","- Data munging: Pandas is designed for practical data cleaning, preparation and munging prior to analysis. NumPy focuses on mathematical functions.\n","- Time Series: Pandas has built-in time series functionality like date_range, shift, rolling averages/sums.
