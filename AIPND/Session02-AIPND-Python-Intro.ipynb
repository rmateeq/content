These instructions are written in a programming language that a computer can understand and execute.\n","\n","**Why Python?**\n","- Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its **simplicity and readability**, making it an excellent choice for **beginners**. It has a **wide range of applications**, from web development and data analysis to scientific research and automation. Python's **extensive standard library and large community of users** and developers make it a versatile and well-supported language.\n","\n","**Why Python 3?**\n","- Python has two major versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is the recommended version for new projects and learning because it's the latest and has better support for modern programming practices. Python 2 is considered legacy and is no longer actively maintained. New learners are encouraged to start with Python 3 to access the latest features, security updates, and community support.\n","\n","**How is Python different from other languages like C/C++/Java?**\n","- Python stands out from languages like C, C++, and Java in several ways:\n","  - **Simplicity:** Python has a straightforward and easy-to-read syntax, which is ideal for beginners. It reduces the amount of code required to perform tasks compared to languages like C and C++.\n","  - **Interpreted Language:** Python is an interpreted language, meaning that you can write and execute code without the need for compilation, which is common in C and C++.\n","  - **Dynamic Typing:** Python uses dynamic typing, allowing variables to change their data type during runtime, making it more flexible compared to statically typed languages like C++ and Java.\n","  - **Extensive Libraries:** Python has a vast standard library that provides pre-built modules and functions for a wide range of tasks, reducing the need to write code from scratch.\n","  - **Community and Ecosystem:** Python has a large and active community of developers, resulting in an extensive ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks for various applications.\n","\n","While Python is an excellent choice for beginners, languages like C, C++, and Java may be preferred for specific use cases where performance, system-level control, or platform-specific applications are necessary."],"metadata":{"id":"tiT4G_DAGWHn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Data Types: Integers, Floats, Booleans\n","\n","In Python, data types are used to represent different kinds of values.
