    "**I. What is Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, **interpreted** programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by *Guido van Rossum* and first released in *1991*. Python has gained immense popularity in various fields, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Setting Up Python Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start coding, let's set up our Python environment. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to install Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebooks on Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing Anaconda on Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Anaconda:**\n",
    "   - Visit the Anaconda download page: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution\n",
    "   - Download the Anaconda Distribution for Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Installer:**\n",
    "   - Locate the downloaded installer file (usually named something like \"Anaconda3-2023.09-x-Windows-x86_64.exe\") and double-click to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Follow the Installer:**\n",
    "   - Follow the installation prompts. You can choose to install Anaconda for just your user or all users on the system. It's typically recommended to select \"Just Me\" unless you have specific system-wide requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choose Installation Location:**\n",
    "   - Specify the installation location. You can use the default location or choose a custom location.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Select Advanced Options:**\n",
    "   - In the \"Advanced Options\" window, make sure to check the box that says \"Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable.\" This allows you to run Anaconda and Python from the command line easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Install Anaconda:**\n",
    "   - Click \"Install\" to start the installation process. This may take a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Completing the Installation:**\n",
    "   - Once the installation is complete, click \"Next.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Launching Jupyter Notebooks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - After installation, you can open Jupyter Notebook from the Windows Start menu. Search for \"Jupyter Notebook\" and click on it to launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - This will open a web browser window with the Jupyter Notebook interface. You can start creating and running Python notebooks right from your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating a New Notebook:**\n",
    "   - In Jupyter Notebook, you can create a new notebook by clicking \"New\" and selecting \"Python 3\" (or any other available Python kernel).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Writing and Running Code:**\n",
    "   - You can write Python code in the notebook cells and run them by clicking the \"Run\" button or by using the Shift + Enter keyboard shortcut.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Saving and Exiting:**\n",
    "   - Save your notebook using the \"Save\" button, and when you're done, you can close the notebook tab. Your work will be saved for the next session.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You've successfully installed Anaconda and launched Jupyter Notebooks on your Windows system. You can now use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive Python programming, data analysis, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of declaring variables in Python:\n",

   "metadata": {},

    "- In this example, we declare four variables: `name`, `age`, `height`, and `is_student`. Python **automatically assigns the appropriate data type** based on the values we provide (string, integer, float, and boolean, respectively).\n",
    "\n",

    "    print(\"This code is indented properly.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"This code is not indented properly.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indentation helps Python determine the **scope of statements within blocks like loops, conditionals, and functions**.\n",
    "- Be consistent with your indentation style (**commonly 4 spaces or a tab**).\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Comments in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are used to provide explanations or notes within your code. Python ignores comments during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single-line comments start with `#`, and multi-line comments are enclosed in triple double-quotes `\"\"\"` or triple single-quotes `'''`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Variables and Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you don't need to declare a variable's data type explicitly. Python infers the data type based on the value assigned to the variable.\n",
