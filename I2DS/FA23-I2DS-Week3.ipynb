    "\n",
    "Welcome to our lecture on functions in Python. Functions are an essential concept in programming that allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions into a reusable block of code. In this section, we'll provide an introduction to what functions are and why they're crucial in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What Are Functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Functions in programming are similar to functions in mathematics. They take input, perform some operations, and produce an output. Think of them as small, self-contained programs within your larger program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why Functions Matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Functions serve several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Reusability**: You can write a function once and use it multiple times in your code, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Modularity**: Functions help you break down a complex program into smaller, manageable parts, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Abstraction**: Functions allow you to abstract the details of a specific task, making your code more readable and easier to understand.\n",

    "### **Defining Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll learn how to define functions in Python and understand their structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Defining a Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "  To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def greet(name):\n",
    "      print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, `greet` is the function name, and `name` is a parameter (also called an argument) that the function accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Function Body**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The function body contains the code that will be executed when the function is called. It is indented under the `def` statement and can include one or more lines of code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def square(number):\n",
    "      result = number ** 2\n",
    "      return result\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this function, we calculate the square of a number and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parameters and Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Parameters are placeholders in the function definition. They specify the values the function expects when called. In our previous examples, `name` and `number` are parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it's called. For instance, when you call `greet(\"Alice\")`, \"Alice\" is an argument passed to the `name` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Returning Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Functions can return values using the `return` statement. The value returned can be used in your code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def add(x, y):\n",
    "      result = x + y\n",
    "      return result\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  When you call `add(3, 5)`, the function returns `8`, which can be assigned to a variable or used directly."

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This calls the `greet` function with \"Alice\" as the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Passing Arguments**\n",
    "\n",
    "  You can pass one or more arguments to a function. When you call the function, the arguments are matched to the parameters in order. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "      result = a * b\n",
    "      return result\n",

    "  product = multiply(4, 7)\n",
    "  ```\n",
