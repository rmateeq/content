    "\n",
    "Exception handling is a programming concept that involves anticipating and managing runtime errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. In Python, exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program, and exception handling provides a mechanism to gracefully address these disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why We Need Exception Handling:**\n",
    "1. **Error Resilience:** Exception handling allows programs to gracefully recover from unexpected errors, preventing abrupt terminations and providing an opportunity to handle errors in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debugging and Logging:** It facilitates debugging by providing detailed information about the nature and location of errors. Exception handling can include logging mechanisms that record errors for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Readability:** Properly handled exceptions contribute to code readability by separating error-handling logic from the main program flow, making the code more understandable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Robustness:** Exception handling makes programs more robust by allowing them to respond intelligently to unforeseen issues, improving overall reliability and user experience."

    "<summary>Click to reveal the answer:</summary>\n",
    "- The `with` statement in Python provides automatic resource management, ensuring that the file is properly closed after the indented block of code is executed. This eliminates the need for explicitly calling `file.close()` and reduces the risk of resource leaks. The `with` statement also handles exceptions more gracefully, making the code cleaner and more readable. It simplifies error handling and ensures that even if an exception occurs, the file will be closed correctly. Overall, the `with` statement enhances code reliability and maintainability when working with file operations."
