    "\n",
    "   - Sometimes, you need to include special characters like single quotes or double quotes within a string.\n",
    "   - You can use the backslash `\\` to escape special characters.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     message = \"She said, \\\"Hello, world!\\\"\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>Click to reveal the details on escape sequence in programming</b></summary>\n",
    "In programming, an escape sequence is a combination of characters that represents a special or control character that cannot be easily expressed or represented as a regular character in a string or character literal. Escape sequences are typically used to include characters like newlines, tabs, quotes, and non-printable characters within a string or character constant. The escape sequence starts with an escape character, often denoted by a backslash `\\`, followed by a character that specifies the special character or action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common escape sequences and their meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `\\\\`: Represents a literal backslash character.\n",
    "2. `\\'`: Represents a single quote character within a single-quoted string.\n",
    "3. `\\\"`: Represents a double quote character within a double-quoted string.\n",
    "4. `\\n`: Represents a newline character, causing text to start on a new line.\n",
    "5. `\\t`: Represents a tab character, causing text to be indented.\n",
    "6. `\\r`: Represents a carriage return character, used to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.\n",
    "7. `\\b`: Represents a backspace character, which moves the cursor one position backward.\n",
    "8. `\\f`: Represents a form feed character, used for page breaks and form feeds.\n",
    "9. `\\v`: Represents a vertical tab character.\n",
    "10. `\\xhh`: Represents a character with the hexadecimal value `hh`. For example, `\\x0A` represents a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Escape sequences are essential for handling special characters and formatting text within strings, particularly in programming languages that use string literals to define text content. They allow you to include characters and control codes that would otherwise be difficult to represent directly in a string."
